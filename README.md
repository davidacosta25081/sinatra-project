BOOK CENTER

Welcome to my Sinatra-ActiveRecord gem. This app will allow to keep track of the books you read.
It includes separate classes for User and Book and the controller actions map to the correct routes in order toprovide a "smooth" and logical user experience.
## Installation


## Usage

To use this app, just clone, run bundle install, rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything should be set up.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
